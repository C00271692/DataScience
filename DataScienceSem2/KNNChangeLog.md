1. Found a good sample on kaggle to get me started with KNN algorithm.

2. Works fine out of the box, understanding the librarys and how to use the Algorithm.

3. Some key points:
    Must normalize the data (as afloat in this case), sot the algorithm can take the correct input
    K values has to be inputted manually, or implement a loop to try different combinations
    Plotting accuracy for different k values
