21/11: ImportedDataSet3Clone.ipynb is the most recent version of the prices of gold graph, and has an actual polynomial line (rather than a line of best fit as in ImportedDataSet3.ipynb).
The polynomial line is  a still work in progress as it doesnt really fit perfectly with the data and is still too linear.

22/10: ImportedDataSet3.ipynb is the prices of gold and this is the file I worked the most on in this iteration.
The other two (ImportedDataSet.ipynb and ImportedDataSet2.ipynb) are about value of homes in california
and the the coorelation of horsepower to miles per gallon bured by a given car.
I have done some work on these but for this iteration my main focus was on the monthly prices of gold (ImportedDataSet3).

LabMain.ipynb is the template for data modelling we did in class and I used is as a guide/template thorughout the other projects
