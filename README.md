# DataScience
This is my 4th year college Datascience Repository for Semester 1 and Semester 2.
In this repository I have multiple Machine Learning and Data Science Algorithms, including
Linear regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, K Means Clustering, K Nearest Neighbour and SVM.
For Semester 1 (A Lab folder), the 2 main algorithms are in ImportedDataset3.ipynb 
(Linear Regression) and ImportedDatasetDecisionTree.ipynb (De0cision Tree). The other are also
implementations of the Linear Regression, however they are not fully well implemetned. I included
them to show my learning curve of the subject and the rocky beginnings.

The main dataset is the 'XAU_1Month_data_2004_to_2024-09-20.csv'.

For Semester 2 I have projects on Naive Bayes, K means clustering, K Nearest Neighbours and SVM.
Files ending in "Large" (e.g K-Nearest-NeigbourLarge.ipynb), use the very large all_car_adverts.csv
dataset, which was too large to push into the repository so I will include a link to that dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guanhaopeng/uk-used-car-market?resource=download

Please Note that all files with "Large" will not work unless you downlaod the all_car_adverts.csv dataset
and place it in the same directory as the algorithms (DataScienceSem2).

The other files (without the "Large" ending) are simple implementation of each algorithm and will work
with the smaller dataset (included in the repo)

For more details on each seperate model view its corresponding ChangeLog.md

Thank you for taking interest in my 4th year Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio!
